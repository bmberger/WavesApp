Waves has two goals to incentivize productivity to everyone for free and help end plastic pollution in our oceans by providing resources to nonprofit cleanups for free.

# Stick to MVP
- Your North Star is your working MVP. Every additional feature: Q: is it part of MVP?
- Get to iteration and market testing asap
- scope creep

# Requirements within App
1. You must do task detail then due date
Reasoning:
- It would either be this or due date then task detail as you need a way to confirm the user is done. This was easy in category as all it was is losing focus from editText. Meanwhile, here we have a date selector and an edit text/

2. No deleting of empty category or empty task
Reasoning:
- it's a common sense
- we delete it for them already when they leave the screen for simplicity

# List of Potential Stretch Goals: 
- Tap for adding
- Gesture movement instead of navigation bar based
- Sharing to some sort of messaging app (e.g. email, messages, etc)
